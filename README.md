  <h1>Platform 2D Game</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my first Java 2D platform game that I created!</p>
  <p>This is Mike, your companion in this game:</p>

  <p>Here's the main page:</p>

  <p>It has 3 levels for now, but you can always add more.</p>
  <p>And this is how the in-game interface looks like:</p>

  <p>For now, you've got 1 enemy, Crabby, which is this one:</p>

  <p>This game is open for improvement and adding more features, enemies, and more.</p>
  <p>If you have any recommendations, I'm happy to hear about them.</p>
  <p>Enjoy trying it out! :D</p>
